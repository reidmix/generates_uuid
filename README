GeneratesUUID
=============

An ActiveRecord mixin to wrap the functionality of uuidtools UUID generation for a particular attribute for a model (database column).  By default, this uuid is stored in a column named +uuid+, to override this behavior, pass a symbol with the column name.  Requires the uuidtools gem found at http://rubyforge.org/projects/uuidtools/, (in svn at /repos/shared/gems/uuidtools/tags/REL-1.0.1).

Example
=======

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    generates_uuid
  end
  
  u = User.create!
  u.uuid => "0ce453f2-9d25-11dc-8e13-001b63955101"
  
  class Resource < ActiveRecord::Base
    generates_uuid :token
  end
  
  r = Resource.create!
  r.token => "7b151730-9cb7-11dc-bb8c-001b63955101"
